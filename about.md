When I was 17, I dropped out of high school to pursue a career in cybersecurity. I started working as a CTF (Capture The Flag) challenge developer while participating in CTF competitions with friends and doing bug bounty hunting on the side.

Later, I joined 1337 coding school as a computer science student. During this time, I also worked as a Python vulnerability assessor for a cybersecurity startup. Eventually, I left school entirely and took on a role as an offensive cybersecurity consultant.
